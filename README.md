# Git-tastic Beat Factory

## A funky rhythm game

###Background
GitHub users fork, push, pull, and clone everyday, but who makes sure those actions reach their correct destination? On the back end of GitHub, a git bot sorts those actions to the beat of his favorite tunes. Under the supervision of Url the unicorn, he must sort all the actions correctly, or Url will take his music away!

###How to Play
Help git bot sort the fork, push, pull, and clone actions as they travel through the factory and down the conveyer belt by pressing the F, G, H, and J keys on your keyboard. The better your timing, the higher your score will be!
